_The new typescript version of [JsGames](https://github.com/DerekToop/jsgames)_

![CI](https://github.com/DerekToop/tsgames/workflows/CI/badge.svg) |

## Background

 [JsGames](https://github.com/DerekToop/jsgames) was built as practices when I started learing javascript around 8 years ago.

 I accidentally found it from my wix site several months ago. It's surprised that I could not remember all the details!

 Finally I dicided to rewrite it with some new techniques, for example, typescript, React, or Angular.

 This is the first step to rebuild it with typescript.
